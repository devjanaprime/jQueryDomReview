One of my favorite skits ever on one of my favorite shows ever. Take 3 min and watch it...

Objective: Review putting things on the DOM using JQuery
--------------------------------------------------------
* Objects
* Array of Objects

We'll have a div on the DOM with an id of "outputDiv". We will be appending info to the DOM in this div. There are two buttons on the DOM that append to the DOM. One will append an object to the DOM. The other will loop through an array of Objects and append them all to this div.
